  <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
  <div>
    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating and designing web pages. It is the backbone of web development and is used to structure content on the internet. HTML consists of a series of elements, each represented by tags, which define the structure and content of a web page.

    <p> Web browsers interpret HTML code to render the content and display web pages to users. Along with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML forms the core technologies used to create dynamic and visually appealing websites.
