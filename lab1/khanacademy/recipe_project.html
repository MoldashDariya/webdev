        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth.
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then add the vanilla extract.
In another bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a uniform dough forms.
Gradually add the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, evenly distributing them throughout the dough.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.
</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).
Shape the dough into small balls and place them on a baking sheet, leaving enough space between each.
</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for approximately 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Cook Lasagna Noodles: Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.

Prepare Sauce: In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or sausage over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and cook until the onions are softened. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Prepare Cheese Mixture: In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese with an egg, mixing until well combined.

Assemble Lasagna: In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Place three lasagna noodles on top. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.
</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Bake: Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Rest and Serve: Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired. Serve and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!
